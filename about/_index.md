Welcome to our page! We are a community of queers and allies in Indian academia, called Queeriosity. Our goal is to create a platform for the voices and expression of queer people, to create a safe space for all queers all over India. 

It was formed collectively by the STEM students from [IISERs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Science_Education_and_Research), [NISER](https://www.niser.ac.in/) and [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/) in 2023. In our country, far from understanding, people do not even recognise the existence of LGBTQAI+ people. [Queerness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer) is often misunderstood—and what people don’t understand, they fear. They fear the change that a queer-affirming society brings: the freedom of self-expression, the refusal to conform, the joy of not being “normal.” Many queer people grow up believing they must bury their truth, whispering to themselves, “I can still live a normal life if I hide.”

Queeriosity exists to challenge that. It is imperative to not only make our existence known, but for our voices to be heard alongside others. With this goal in mind, we created this community for people in Indian academia to come together; a safe space for everyone, a platform to share your expression. To show the world how beautiful, bold, and liberating that change can be.
To celebrate the moment you finally stop fitting in—and start being yourself. This site is a proud declaration: we are enough.

If you are someone who would like to understand queer people and support them in your life, do check out the resources section to learn more about us! 

To all the queer people reading this, not only are you enough the way you are, you are majestic! To shake off the homophobia and accept yourself in our society, is no small feat. Your identity is a prideful declaration to the world, that not only do you exist, but you do so fabulously. Let us break down the binaries of gender and sexualities together! We look forward to you joining our community. This is a space to share your art, your thoughts, your stories—to just be, without fear or judgment.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to showcase your queer-related art, writing, or anything cool you’re passionate about. We’re open to queer creators and allies alike—and we can’t wait to see what you bring to the table.
