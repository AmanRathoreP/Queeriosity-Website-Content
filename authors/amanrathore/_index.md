I'm a First-year([MS24058](mailto:ms24058@iisermohali.ac.in)) BS-MS student at IISER Mohali. Before collage I studied in [Saint Paul's Kota](https://saintpaulskota.co.in/) since LKG(2010). I really love animals especially furry animals. I'm interested in biology, maths, physics, electronics, robotics, computers. I have a good grasp of mathematics, physics, and computer science, and I love biology more than anything. I really love programming and anything that uses computers.
